Feature ratio: 0.256
VLM verdict: same
VLM confidence: 1.00
Reasoning: The two figures are identical in every aspect: same data points, same chart type (scatter plots), same axes labels and ranges, same legend, same annotations (e.g., 17.86, 6.93, λ=0.05), and same overall pattern/trend. The only difference is the file format (image vs. PDF), but the visual content is exactly the same.
